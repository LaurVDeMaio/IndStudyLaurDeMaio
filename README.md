# Adaptability of Reinforcement Learning Agent from Simple to Complex Environments

<body><b>Abstract:</b> <br>
Reinforcement learning is a form of machine learning that operates on a reward-based training methodology. Within this framework, an AI Agent is presented with goal-oriented observations and subsequently executes actions to achieve the specified goal. In this experiment, we conducted training for an agent within an environment featuring a solitary obstacle and a singular goal. Following the completion of the training phase, we subjected the trained agent to environments containing varying numbers of obstacles; specifically one, two, three, four, five, and ten obstacles. Here, we aim to evaluate the adaptability and problem-solving capabilities of the simply trained AI Agent across diverse environmental conditions. This assessment aimed to gauge the agent's proficiency in navigating through environments with differing obstacle amounts while striving to attain its objective.
