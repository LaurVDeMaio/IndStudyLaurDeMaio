# Adaptability of Reinforcement Learning Agent from Simple to Complex Environments

Abstractâ€”Reinforcement learning is a method where AI agents observe their environment and receive rewards for completing a task or goal. In this study, we evaluate how different observation types enable an agent to perform the same task when trained in a simple environment and then placed in more complex, varied environments.  We prepared two different types of RL agents. One trained using visual input from a virtual camera and another using raycast sensors (analogous to a rangefinder). These agents were trained in a simulated Unity environment with a single obstacle and goal. After training, the model used for avoiding a single obstacle was tested in environments with multiple obstacles. In all our tests, the agent trained with raycast sensors had a higher average rate of reaching the goal successfully over camera input. Additionally, training with raycast sensors provides a smaller model size and reduced training time.
